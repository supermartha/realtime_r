Real Time R Code
================

R code for analyzing real-time sociolinguistic perception data collected using the Real Time web code. (ADD LINK here once webcode has a home.)

## Required packages
- plyr
- reshape2
- *suggested*: lmerTest for model-building (used in *example_plots_and_analysis.r*)

## Quick start
- To try out with our sample data, see example_plots_and_analysis.
- To use your own data, run *prep_web_data.r* to compile web results into a dataframe, then see example_plots_and_analysis.r.

## Included files
- **example_plots_and_analysis.r**: Example plots and analysis.
- **functions.r**: Contains *addTimepoints()* function, which is used by *prep_web_data.r*.
- **generate_sample_data.py**: (You shouldn't ever need to use this.) Python script used to generate our sample web data.
- **plotting_functions.r**: Various functions for plotting.
- **prep_web_data.r**: Code to compile results of web-based experiment into single dataframe and save as CSV file.
- **sample_results/ directory**: Example webcode results, randomly generated by *generate_sample_data.py*.
- **sample_prolific_data.csv**: Example webcode results, created by running data in *sample_results/* directory through *prep_web_data.r* script.
- **slope_functions.r**: Functions for slopes analysis, the main statistical analysis in our paper.
